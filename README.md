# Hangman
This application is a Hangman game which I created in my first year of the Bachelor of Information Technology Course at the Southern Institute of Technology

This application allows the player to choose from 3 different lists of words that can be played. These are ANIMALs, CITIES and WORDS

Once the user has selected a list, the game randomly chooses a word from the list that the player must guess.

If the user chose to play EASY mode the letters that the player has already used to guess hide, otherwise if the user has chosen HARD the letter will remain visible making the game harder to play.

If the user correctly guesses the word within the number of tries, they are then promopted to play again or finish the game.

If the user incorrectly guesses the word within the number of tries, they are then told what the word is as well as allowing them to play again or finish the game.

If the user plays again it chooses another random word from the list that the player initally chose.

If the user decides that they want to end the game, they are then directed to a new screen allowing them to enter a High Score (read and written to a simple TXT File) or they can exit the game.
